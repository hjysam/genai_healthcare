title: Diabetic Foot Care

Can diabetes affect the feet? Diabetic foot complications are a common concern for individuals with poorly-controlled diabetes, often leading to nerve damage and circulation issues, particularly in the feet and legs. This can result in the development of diabetic foot ulcers, infections, and deformities. Early identification and intervention through diabetic foot screening are crucial in preventing complications and reducing the need for amputations. At polyclinics, a team of registered assistant nurses is specially trained to conduct diabetic foot screenings, identifying symptoms and providing education on proper foot care and blood sugar control. They can also refer at-risk patients to podiatrists for early intervention.

To minimize the risk of diabetic foot complications, individuals should prioritize regular foot care. This includes proper hygiene, inspecting the feet daily for any abnormalities, wearing comfortable and well-fitting shoes, and maintaining good blood sugar control. By following these guidelines and seeking timely medical attention when needed, individuals can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing serious diabetic foot issues. Looking after your feet is crucial to maintaining your overall health and well-being. It is important to check your feet and toes daily for any signs of cuts, sores, corns, or blisters. If you have difficulty seeing the soles of your feet, use a mirror or ask for assistance. If you notice any changes in your feet, such as a change in color or appearance, it is essential to see your doctor immediately. Choosing comfortable, well-fitting shoes and always wearing socks or stockings can help protect your feet from injury. Before wearing shoes, make sure to check the inside for any sharp edges or objects that could cause discomfort.

Proper foot hygiene is also essential. Wash your feet daily with water and mild soap, being careful not to soak them. Ensure the water is not too hot to prevent scalding. After washing, dry your feet thoroughly, paying special attention to the areas between your toes. To prevent dryness and cracks, apply moisturizing lotion to your feet, avoiding the areas between your toes. Additionally, it is important to protect your feet from extreme temperatures and keep the blood flowing by elevating your feet when sitting. By following these simple steps, you can maintain the health and well-being of your feet for years to come. When sitting, it is important to take care of your feet by putting them up and avoiding crossing your legs for extended periods. Wriggle your toes and flex your feet up and down to promote circulation. Additionally, it is advised to refrain from smoking, as it can have detrimental effects on your overall health. Remember to prioritize your well-being and not lose sleep over concerns related to diabetes.
