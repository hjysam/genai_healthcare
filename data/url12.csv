Aim for HbA1c levels below 7 for optimal control, blood pressure below 140/80, and LDL cholesterol below 2.6 mmol/L.

"Weight management is an important part of diabetes care. Body Mass Index (BMI) screens for weight categories that may lead to increased risk of cardiovascular health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual.

If you are overweight (BMI 23 and more), even losing 5 – 10% of your weight can help lower your blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. To calculate your BMI, use the formula: BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) x Height (m)), then check against the table. Speak to your healthcare team for personalized advice on how best to achieve or maintain an optimal weight. Keeping within your optimal weight range is important for achieving better blood sugar levels. The BMI categories are as follows:  
- 27.5 and above: High risk for cardiovascular diseases

"Self-monitoring of blood sugar is crucial for managing diabetes effectively. Keeping your blood sugar levels within the target range can help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. Monitoring your glucose levels allows you to understand how food, physical activity, and insulin doses impact your blood sugar levels, enabling you to make necessary adjustments for optimal diabetes control. Blood sugar targets should be personalized to avoid hypoglycemia and other adverse effects associated with overly tight control.

It is important to consult with your healthcare team to determine if self-monitoring is necessary, which tools to use, and how frequently to check your blood sugar. Your target blood sugar range may vary based on factors such as age, lifestyle, and overall health. Checking your blood sugar levels before meals, two hours after eating, before bedtime, before and after exercise, when feeling unwell, and as needed in consultation with your healthcare provider is essential for effective diabetes management.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,26
"""Why is Blood Sugar Monitoring Important? Blood sugar monitoring gives you a clear idea of your blood sugar level at a given time. It informs if you have hypoglycemia (blood sugar too low) or hyperglycemia (blood sugar too high) at a given time.

This helps you and your diabetes healthcare team evaluate and determine the best management strategy for you.""",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,27
"How to Monitor Blood Sugar:
Blood Glucose Meter
Blood sugar level can be easily monitored using a Blood Glucose Meter. Prick your finger and put a small drop of blood on the meter’s test strip. Your blood sugar level will appear on the meter within seconds. Blood sugar and interstitial fluid glucose levels are usually similar to each other, and glucose levels can also be measured from the interstitial fluid. There are two types of monitors that measure interstitial fluid glucose: flash glucose monitors and continuous glucose monitors. A blood glucose meter is usually the least expensive home testing option, but it only reveals your blood sugar level at the time of check. Remember to wash your hands with soap and water and dry with tissue.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,28
"Flash Glucose Monitor (FGM) consists of a sensor and a reader, and depending on the type of sensor, it is placed either at the back of the upper arm, on the abdomen, or the upper buttocks. FGMs can be used up to 14 days. It allows you to view interstitial fluid glucose levels at the time of check and can tell you if your glucose levels are rising, falling, or stable. FGMs can also give you a report on the daily pattern of your glucose levels. It does not require blood sugar (finger prick) calibration. Some do not have alarms. Sensor readings are not automatically synced with the reader. You will need to flash the reader over the sensor to record your glucose readings.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,29
"Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) is a system that consists of a sensor, a transmitter, and a receiver. The sensor usually needs to be replaced every 3 to 7 days. It collects glucose readings every few minutes, providing a more comprehensive view of your glucose profile compared to a blood glucometer. The CGM can trigger alarms if glucose levels are too high or too low. Some types of CGM systems require calibration with a blood glucose meter, which involves a finger prick. Monitoring blood sugar levels is essential for managing diabetes effectively.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,30
"Glucose level targets should be tailored to your condition. Please discuss with your healthcare team. Pre-meal glucose targets are 4.0 – 7.0 mmol/L, and 2-hour post-meal glucose should be less than 10.0 mmol/L.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,31
"Hypoglycemia, also known as low blood sugar, occurs when your blood sugar level falls below 4.0 mmol/L. This can happen due to an imbalance between insulin intake and the body's physiological needs, insulin overdose from injecting too much insulin without eating enough carbohydrates, ill-timed insulin intake, using the wrong type of insulin, increased sensitivity to insulin, increased glucose utilization during or shortly after exercise, and a mismatch between food intake timing and sulphonylureas consumption.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,32
"Hypoglycemia is when the blood sugar levels are lower than normal. This usually occurs at blood sugar levels less than 4 mmol/L. The severity of hypoglycemia can be categorized into three levels: mild, moderate, and severe. 

Mild hypoglycemia is defined as blood sugar levels between 3.1 - 3.9 mmol/L, while moderate hypoglycemia is when levels are less than 3.1 mmol/L. Severe hypoglycemia is characterized by blood sugar levels less than 2.2 mmol/L or when the individual needs help to treat and cannot self-treat.

Symptoms of hypoglycemia include fast heartbeat, dizziness, headache, sweating, unceasing hunger despite having a full and balanced meal, irritability, weakness, blurred vision, slurred speech, confusion, abnormal behavior, and seizures. If an individual has lost consciousness due to severe hypoglycemia, it is crucial to call an ambulance immediately as they cannot self-treat in such situations.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,33

Pioglitazone and metformin reduce the amount of sugar made by the liver and increase the sensitivity of fat, liver, and muscle cells to insulin. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin prevent the kidneys from reabsorbing sugar. Glipizide, tolbutamide, and gliclazide help the pancreas produce more insulin.

To avoid swelling and ensure proper insulin absorption, it is recommended to rotate injection sites, such as the right and left thigh. When rotating injection sites, move two fingers' breadth away from the last injection site until you have used the entire area. It is advised to change to a new injection area every 1 to 2 weeks. Suitable sites for insulin injection include the outer side of the upper arms, the upper and outer side of the thighs, the upper outer quadrant of the buttocks, and the abdomen, at least 2.5 cm away from the belly button in any direction.",12.4 Be Proactive (updated 22Jan2024).pdf,43
