Appropriate Care Guide (ACG) First Published: 3 July 2017 Last updated: 27 July 2021 Managing pre-diabetes – a growing health concern. 

Key message 1: Pre-diabetes is asymptomatic but puts a person at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Key message 2: Early diagnosis, appropriate management and follow-up help to prevent or delay T2DM in persons with pre-diabetes. Key message 3: Recommend lifestyle intervention to all persons with pre-diabetes. Key message 4: Tailor lifestyle intervention to individual needs for sustained behavioural changes. Key message 5: Consider metformin for persons with pre-diabetes when glycaemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention OR they are unable to adopt lifestyle intervention, especially if persons outlined in the two points above have a body mass index (BMI) of ≥23 kg/m², are younger than 60 years of age, or are women with a history of gestational diabetes.

Preventing or delaying the progression to T2DM:  Pre-diabetes is defined by glycaemic levels that are higher than normal, but lower than diabetes thresholds. Pre-diabetes is asymptomatic but predisposes individuals to T2DM and CVD. Around 14% of Singaporeans have impaired glucose tolerance and without lifestyle changes, at least 35% of persons with pre-diabetes in Singapore will progress to T2DM within eight years.1,2 There is a pressing need to address pre-diabetes as part of the efforts to reduce the impact of T2DM and CVD. Education increases awareness of pre-diabetes and enables individuals to adopt lifestyle changes.

Diagnosis of pre-diabetes. In Singapore, glucose thresholds in Table 1 below are used to diagnose pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance). Table 1. Glucose thresholds for pre-diabetes: Pre-diabetes: IFG (impaired fasting glucose): Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) is between 6.1–6.9 and the 2-hr post-load glucose (mmol/L) is <7.8. IGT (impaired glucose tolerance): Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L) is <7.0 and the 2-hr post-load glucose (mmol/L) is between 7.8–11.0. There is also a footnote that says, In Singapore, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is not currently indicated as a diagnostic test for pre-diabetes.

Lifestyle intervention Lifestyle intervention is recommended for all persons with pre-diabetes, as adopting healthy diet and increased physical activity reduces the risk of them developing T2DM by 31 to 37% over 2 to 6 years, and is cost-effective.3-5 For those who are overweight or obese, aim to gradually achieve and maintain a BMI of < 23 kg/m2 or a 5 to 10% body weight loss. Smokers are advised to stop smoking, as smoking impairs glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and secretion.6 Healthy diet A healthy and balanced diet plays a key role in preventing or delaying the progression to T2DM in persons with pre-diabetes. Advise those who are overweight or obese to achieve weight loss by implementing a negative caloric balance. Increased physical activity Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are major risk factors for developing T2DM and can be modified by an increase in physical activity. Pedometers or fitness trackers allow progress to be monitored over time and may provide additional motivation.

Instructions on lifestyle intervention to be conveyed to persons with pre-diabetes during consultations. It includes recommendations for a healthy diet, advice on alcohol intake, and guidelines for increased physical activity.  Healthy diet by portion a healthy plate, avoid sweetened beverages and foods, eat less fat, limit alcohol intake. For Portion a healthy plate: Fill half the plate with vegetables and a small portion of fruits, Fill a quarter of the plate with lean meat, fish, poultry (skinless), eggs, low-fat dairy, or soy products and Fill a quarter of the plate with whole grains, such as brown rice, rolled oats, whole grain bread or cereals. For avoiding sweetened beverages and foods, opt for water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (such as soda, fruit juice, energy drinks). For Eat less fat, avoid pastries, fried food, and food containing coconut milk or cream and use less oil when cooking and use healthier oils (such as sunflower oil, rice bran oil, olive oil) instead of butter, ghee, or palm oil. For Limit alcohol intake, no more than one standard drink per day for female and no more than two standard drinks per day for male. To Increase physical activity, perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (such as brisk walking, leisure cycling), or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise (such as jogging, fast-paced cycling, swimming laps) every week; avoid more than two consecutive days without exercise; and engage in exercises that require intensity and that accelerate the heart rate.

Sustained behavioural changes: Individualized advice is necessary for robust and sustained lifestyle changes. For tailor lifestyle intervention to individual needs: by assessing lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity preferences, work nature, and budget constraints; and identify areas for improvement and provide practical, sustainable lifestyle changes. For  reinforce behavioural changes continuously by encouraging individuals with pre-diabetes to keep a log of their diet, exercise, and weight, visit the HealthHub website, and use related applications. Supplement verbal advice with written information. There is also a QR code to access pre-diabetes information on the HealthHub website.

Pharmacotherapy is considered less effective than lifestyle changes for pre-diabetes and should only be considered after a trial of intensive lifestyle intervention. The benefits, side effects, and costs should be discussed before starting treatment. Metformin is the recommended drug due to strong evidence and safety data, showing a 26% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) over three years. Acarbose has shown a favorable trend in preventing or delaying T2DM in pre-diabetes. However, the evidence for acarbose is not as robust or well-studied as for metformin. It should be considered only when metformin is not well-tolerated, as it works by decreasing postprandial glucose. Its glucose-lowering effect is more likely to benefit persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) than those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG). For metformin: Indicated for persons with pre-diabetes when glycemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention, or they are unable to adopt lifestyle intervention. Specifically recommended for individuals with a BMI of ≥23 kg/m², who are younger than 60 years of age, or are women with a history of gestational diabetes. Start at 250 mg twice daily and increase as tolerated, up to 850 mg twice daily. Metformin should be taken with meals to reduce side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Pathway for managing pre-diabetes. The process begins with the diagnosis of pre-diabetes, which can be determined by one of two criteria. Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) is characterized by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L and a 2-hour post-load glucose (2-h PG) level of less than 7.8 mmol/L. Alternatively, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is defined by an FPG level of less than 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-h PG level between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L. For all persons with pre-diabetes, a lifestyle intervention is recommended. This includes education on a healthy diet and increased physical activity. For those who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a body mass index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or to realize a 5-10% body weight loss. Regular follow-up is crucial and should include monitoring at least every six months with BMI and FPG, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or HbA1c assessments as appropriate. Additionally, yearly screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is advised. Reinforcement of behavioral changes is also a key component of regular follow-up. In cases where an individual’s glycemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention, adding metformin is advised. Before beginning metformin, measure HbA1c and renal function. The starting dose for metformin is 250 mg twice daily, which may be gradually increased as tolerated based on glycemic status, up to 850 mg twice daily. Even with the introduction of metformin, continuing lifestyle intervention is recommended unless it is unfeasible for the individual to do so. For those unable to adopt a lifestyle intervention, the approach to metformin administration remains the same. Finally, regular follow-up should be continued with monitoring every six months with BMI and HbA1c reviews. Renal function should be assessed at least yearly. Yearly screenings for CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia should continue. There is also a suggestion to consider monitoring vitamin B12 levels, especially for those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy. The pathway for management also indicates that if the HbA1c level is 7.0% or higher, management should proceed as it would for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). If after metformin intervention the fasting plasma glucose or OGTT are not reflective of T2DM, a metformin washout period of 1-2 weeks is recommended for further testing.

Overview of lifestyle intervention in pre-diabetes. Role of lifestyle intervention in pre-diabetes management. It highlights that lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) by 31% to 37% over a period of 2 to 6 years. For individuals who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or accomplish a 5 to 10% reduction in body weight. The image also includes icons suggesting that lifestyle interventions may include activities such as healthy eating, cycling, and other forms of physical exercise. Implementing lifestyle intervention through diet is crucial for managing pre-diabetes. This approach emphasizes portion control and the avoidance of certain types of food and beverages. For a healthy diet, it is suggested to portion your plate in the following way: 25% should consist of lean meat, low-fat dairy, or soy products; another 25% should be whole grains, such as brown rice; and the remaining 50% of the plate should be filled with vegetables and a small portion of fruits. In terms of beverages and food, it is recommended to avoid sugar-sweetened items, as indicated by a Say No message over a glass of fruit juice. Alcohol consumption should also be limited. For females, the intake should be restricted to one standard drink per day, which is equivalent to approximately 100ml of wine, 285ml of beer, or 30ml of spirits. For males, the intake should be limited to two standard drinks per day. By following these guidelines, one can effectively manage pre-diabetes through dietary intervention. The recommendations for lifestyle modifications focus on physical activity and other health-related changes. For physical activity, there are two options: engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or leisure cycling, or alternatively, pursue at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity exercise, such as jogging or fast-paced cycling. The importance of regularity in exercise is also noted, suggesting that one should not have more than two consecutive days without exercise to maintain effectiveness. In addition to these, other modifications include smoking cessation. This is indicated by an icon of a person with a cancelled cigarette symbol, emphasizing the importance of stopping smoking as part of a healthy lifestyle change. By following these recommendations, one can make significant strides towards a healthier lifestyle. The two-part strategy on how to sustain lifestyle changes involves tailoring lifestyle intervention to individual needs and reinforcing behavioral changes. The first part of the strategy emphasizes the importance of personalizing the intervention. This involves taking into account personal preferences, considering the individual’s budget, adapting to the physical condition of the person, and factoring in the nature of the individual's work. The second part of the strategy focuses on reinforcing behavioral changes by encouraging a regular log of diet, exercise, and weight. Keeping a diet log helps monitor eating habits and nutritional intake. An exercise log keeps track of physical activity, and a weight log helps observe changes and progress over time. By implementing this two-part strategy, individuals can effectively sustain lifestyle changes and work towards their health goals.
