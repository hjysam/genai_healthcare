"Diabetes is a condition where your body cannot manage sugar properly, resulting in too much sugar in your blood. What is diabetes?",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,1
"Diabetes is a common and serious condition in Singapore. Close to 1 in 10 Singaporeans has diabetes. 2 in 3 individuals with newly diagnosed kidney failure have diabetes. 1 in 3 individuals diagnosed with diabetes continues to have high blood sugar levels. 1 in 3 individuals with diabetes does not know he or she has it. 1 in 3 individuals with diabetes has eye disease. Every day, about 4 individuals with diabetes undergo amputations due to complications.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,2
"Diabetes can cause complications for your body, including high blood sugar, tooth decay, gum disease, stroke, heart attack, blindness, kidney failure, ulcer, amputation, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and blood vessel damage.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,3
"Diabetes can cause complications for your body, including high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high blood cholesterol which can damage blood vessels. This damage may not be noticeable until you screen for these complications. Complications of diabetes include small blood vessel (microvascular) damage, nerve damage (neuropathy), large blood vessel (macrovascular) damage such as stroke (cerebrovascular disease), heart disease (cardiovascular disease), and circulatory problems (peripheral vascular disease). Other complications include loss of feeling in the feet, increased risk of foot ulcers and infections, eye disease (retinopathy), and reduced kidney function (nephropathy).",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,4
"Types of diabetes mellitus include Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin due to an autoimmune condition. This condition is not caused by diet and lifestyle and typically develops in children or early adulthood. On the other hand, Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and is usually associated with the body's cells not responding well to insulin. It is commonly linked to being overweight and having excessive body fat. Gestational diabetes is another type that some women develop during pregnancy, which can increase the risk of developing diabetes later in life.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,5
"Symptoms that may be common to both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes include the need to urinate often, feeling thirsty often, losing weight without trying, feeling often hungry, experiencing blurred vision, and numbness or tingling in hands/feet. 

Type 1 diabetes typically has a fast onset, often over a few days, while Type 2 diabetes may not have obvious symptoms or the symptoms can be easily missed. If ignored, both types of diabetes can lead to serious complications. For Type 1 diabetes, this can include Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) where ketones build up in the bloodstream. For Type 2 diabetes, complications may include Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Syndrome (HHS) where blood sugar is dangerously high and the body becomes severely dehydrated. 

Additional symptoms specific to Type 2 diabetes may include feeling tired easily, having dry skin, experiencing sores or wounds that take a long time to heal, and being prone to infections, commonly involving the skin, urine, or lungs.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,6
"Pre-diabetes is when your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes. Having pre-diabetes puts you at an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. Making lifestyle changes, such as healthy eating, can delay the progression to diabetes or reverse pre-diabetes. People with pre-diabetes usually have no symptoms. The only way to diagnose if you have pre-diabetes is through blood tests.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,7
"Sure! Here is the revised sentence: ""Be aware of how diabetes develops.""",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,8
"Risk factors for developing pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes include having a family member with diabetes, a history of diabetes during pregnancy, being 40 years of age or older, having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 23.0 kg/m2 or higher, leading an inactive (sedentary) lifestyle, and having unhealthy eating habits.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,9
"Insulin is a hormone that helps control the blood sugar level in your body. It is produced by beta cells in the pancreas, which acts as an insulin factory. Insulin moves sugar (glucose) into the cells, where it is used to generate energy and maintain normal body functions.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,10
"How Type 1 diabetes develops:
The body’s immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas, which act as the insulin factory. Without sufficient insulin, the body cannot transport glucose from the bloodstream into the cells for energy, leading to high blood sugar levels.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,11
"How Type 2 diabetes develops: Over time, the overworked pancreas becomes damaged and produces less insulin, making it harder to keep blood sugar levels normal. As the body does not require this excess sugar for energy, it is converted and stored as fat. If there is excess fat in the body, the body cells do not respond well to insulin. More insulin is needed to move sugar from the bloodstream into body cells, further stressing the pancreas. Frequent intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates causes blood sugar levels to rise, forcing the pancreas (insulin factory) to work harder to produce more insulin to control blood sugar levels.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,12
"High blood sugar levels cause your pancreas, the insulin factory, to work harder. Eating food high in sugar causes blood sugar levels to rise, forcing the pancreas to produce more insulin to control blood sugar levels. This can lead to an overworked pancreas.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,13
"Fat is stored in different areas of the body, including under the skin and surrounding organs. While fat under the skin is visible, the fat surrounding organs and muscles is not visible to us. Having less internal fat is considered healthier, even if a person appears to have less fat under the skin. If someone is Thin Outside, Fat Inside (TOFI), they are at risk of diabetes due to excess internal fat, especially if they have an apple-shaped body. Excess sugar in the body is stored as fat, leading to potential health risks, even if a person appears thin.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,14
"Excess internal fat can cause problems by leading to inflammation and damage of body cells. Consequences of excess fat in the body include insulin resistance, high blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Additionally, excess internal fat can cause damage to the pancreas and other organs.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,15
"Sure! Here is the revised sentence: ""What can I do to manage diabetes?""",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,16
"Individuals with diabetes should never consume sugar. With good diabetes control and knowing your personal requirements, you may be able to include some sugars into your daily eating plan. You can safely exercise as long as you can keep a close watch on your blood sugar levels. If you are on insulin and oral tablets like sulphonylureas, adjust your dose if necessary, and pack some snacks to consume in the event of hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar). Taking insulin helps you manage the condition, but it will not make the disease go away.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,17

Tips for those with Type 1 diabetes: Be aware.,10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,19
"Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient found in foods and drinks. When your body digests food and drinks that contain carbohydrates, they are broken down into glucose, which is your body’s preferred source of energy. Consuming large amounts of carbohydrates can lead to high blood sugar levels, requiring more insulin to bring glucose levels back to normal. Carbohydrate counting is essential for individuals with Type 1 diabetes, as it involves matching insulin doses to the amount of carbohydrates consumed. This practice helps adjust insulin doses based on food and drink intake. Speak to your care team for a personalized treatment plan tailored to your needs.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,20
"Seek medical attention immediately if you cannot eat, drink, or take your medication or insulin, or if you are feeling increasingly drowsy or confused. Keep eating or drinking, even if you have difficulty with normal meals. Try taking snacks or drinks in small frequent portions throughout the day. If you are experiencing low glucose levels (below 4 mmol/L or your target range), follow the 15-15 rule: take 15g of fast-acting sugars, re-check in 15 minutes, and repeat if still low.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,21

"Sure! Here is the revised sentence: ""Traditional and complementary medicine can be beneficial for managing diabetes.""",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,27
"Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) aims to supplement general health and is not an alternative treatment for diabetes. The concurrent use of T&CM with diabetic treatments may not be suitable for all. Improper T&CM use has caused harm like burns from moxibustion. Such risks are greater in individuals who have complications arising from diabetes e.g., decreased feeling or sensation due to neuropathy, or kidney failure. Please speak to your doctor before starting any T&CM treatment.",10.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-01-BeAware.pdf,28
"In Singapore, Traditional Medicine (TM) typically refers to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Traditional Malay Medicine (TMM), Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM). Complementary Medicine (CM) refers to all other forms of medicine that are non-mainstream, e.g., chiropractic, osteopathy, aromatherapy. Scientific studies on the effectiveness of T&CM for diabetes and its complications are inconclusive or insufficient. Before considering starting T&CM, continue with Western medicine unless advised otherwise by your doctor. Seek advice from a T&CM practitioner before taking herbal medicines or supplements.
