Healthy eating is essential for managing diabetes. It is important to maintain a balanced diet to help control blood sugar levels and prevent complications. Eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats can support overall health and well-being for individuals with diabetes. Regular physical activity is also beneficial in managing diabetes and promoting overall wellness. It is important to work with a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to create a personalized meal plan that meets individual needs and preferences.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,0
"Healthy eating is recommended for everyone, including individuals with diabetes. Diet is an important part of diabetes management, as eating well not only helps with diabetes control but also with weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and general health. All individuals can enjoy the same healthy meals. For a general guide on making healthy food choices and having a balanced diet, speak to a healthcare professional such as a dietitian for personalized nutritional advice.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,1
A healthy diet includes foods like tofu and being active.,11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,2
"Healthy eating is crucial when managing diabetes. Carbohydrates have the most significant impact on blood sugar levels. While protein and fat do not directly affect blood sugar, consuming excessive amounts can lead to weight gain, increasing insulin resistance and complicating diabetes control. It is important to consume the right types and amounts of fats, favoring mono- and polyunsaturated fats over saturated and trans fats. Our bodies require macronutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fat for energy, and it's essential to eat a variety of foods in appropriate portions daily for a balanced diet. Additionally, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals play a vital role in various body functions, including bone health and immune system support.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,3

""What should I eat? My Healthy Plate is a visual guide you can use to help you make healthy food choices. A balanced meal consists of: ¼ plate of whole grains, ¼ plate of good sources of protein, ½ plate of fruit and vegetables. We should also be mindful to choose water as your drink of choice, choose healthier oils which are lower in saturated fats, and keep physically active.""",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,4
"Whole grains are richer in nutrients compared to refined grains such as white rice as they have not been over-processed. They are rich in fiber, which helps you feel full for longer, preventing overeating. A quarter plate of whole grains equals 2 servings of carbohydrates. The daily recommended intake is 5 to 7 servings of carbohydrates.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,5
"To maintain a healthy diet for managing diabetes, it is important to include a quarter plate of protein in your meals. Protein sources can come from both animal-based options like eggs, fish, chicken, and dairy products such as milk and yogurt, as well as plant-based sources like soy milk, tofu, nuts, beans, and legumes. When selecting protein sources, opt for lean meats over fatty cuts and fresh options instead of processed meats. It's also beneficial to have a combination of animal-based and plant-based proteins in your diet. One serving of protein is equivalent to a quarter plate, and the recommended daily intake is between 2 to 3 servings. Remember to stay active and incorporate tofu into your meals for a balanced and nutritious diet.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,6
"Tips for eating fruit and vegetables:
- End your meal with fresh or frozen fruit for dessert.
- Eat whole fruit instead of drinking fruit juices, as juices can cause a spike in blood sugar levels. The pulp and skin of the fruit are high in fiber, which slows the absorption of sugar into your blood.
- Add vegetables/fruits to your meat dishes to add color, flavor, and fiber.
Daily recommended intake: at least 2 servings of fruit and 2 servings of vegetables.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,7

Drinks
• Make water your drink of choice. Sugary drinks can make diabetes control more difficult and lead to weight gain.
• Unsweetened tea and coffee can be taken in moderation.
• Canned drinks usually contain a large amount of sugar. Opt for diet or 'zero' versions.
• If you choose a sugary drink, avoid drinks with Nutri-Grade mark C or D. Opt for healthier options with reduced sugar, such as drinks with the Healthier Choice Symbol or Nutri-Grade mark A or B.
• Fruit juices are not recommended as they often contain large amounts of naturally occurring fruit sugar.

""Monitoring carbohydrate intake is important for managing blood sugar levels in diabetes.""",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,9
"Carbohydrates are an important nutrient found in foods and drinks. They are converted to glucose by the body and are essential for providing energy. It is unnecessary to avoid carbohydrates as they are the main source of energy in the human diet and should be included in a healthy eating plan for individuals with diabetes. A balanced meal provides the body with necessary nutrients.

Carbohydrates are converted to glucose through the digestive system breaking down the carbohydrates in food. This process leads to a rise in blood sugar levels as the glucose enters the bloodstream. It is important to understand that different carbohydrates affect blood sugar levels differently. Knowing how quickly a carbohydrate food converts to sugar can help optimize blood sugar control.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,10
There are 3 types of carbohydrates: Sugars are simple carbohydrates that are easy to digest. They raise blood sugar levels quickly. Starches are complex carbohydrates that are made up of sugars linked together. The speed at which starches are digested by the body into sugar depends on how processed they are and how much fiber the food item contains. Fiber is the part of complex carbohydrates that cannot be digested by the body. It makes you feel full and helps with sugar control by slowing down the passage of food through the digestive system.,11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,11
"Naturally occurring sugar is found in foods like fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Excessive intake of this sugar can lead to weight gain and suboptimal control of glucose. Examples include fructose found in fruits and lactose found in milk. Added sugar, which includes any sugar or caloric sweetener added to food or beverages during processing or preparation, can also contribute to these issues. Examples of added sugar are molasses and high fructose corn syrup.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,12
"Sugars can be both a natural sugar AND an added sugar. Examples include sucrose (also known as table sugar or granulated sugar) and honey, which are natural sugars commonly added to food and drinks. Avoid food and drinks with “added sugar” (e.g., cakes, sugar-sweetened soft drinks, cookies) and beware of items with “no sugar added” as they may already contain naturally occurring sugar (e.g., fruit juice). Excessive intake of such foods contributes to caloric intake and can lead to weight gain and sub-optimal blood sugar control.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,13
"Starches should make up ¼ of your plate. Choose wholegrain/wholemeal varieties, such as brown rice, as they result in a more gradual rise in blood sugar levels than their refined versions such as white rice. Examples include brown rice, rolled oats, potato with skin on, sweet potato, corn, yam, and legumes such as peas. Minimize foods made from refined grains and processed starchy foods. They tend to be stripped of nutrients and fiber, and can cause a quicker rise in blood sugar levels. Examples include white bread, instant oats, white rice, skinless or mashed potato.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,14
"Dietary fibre can slow carbohydrate digestion and glucose absorption, for better blood sugar control. High fibre foods include vegetables, fruits, and whole-grain products. Increase your fibre intake by switching to these options: brown rice, wholewheat noodles and pasta, wholegrain bread, steel-cut or rolled oats. These contain more dietary fibre than their refined versions and can help manage blood sugar levels.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,15
"The Glycaemic Index (GI) measures how fast food or drink can cause blood sugar levels to rise. It ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based on this impact. The higher the GI, the faster blood sugar levels are expected to rise. Eating foods lower in GI leads to a slower increase in blood sugar over time and reduces the spike in the body's insulin hormone response. This also helps the individual feel full longer.",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,16
"There are limitations in relying on GI alone to make healthy food choices. Fat in a food item lowers its GI, so not all low GI food are healthy choices. A diet high in fat and calories may have a low GI, but it increases the risk of weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease. Less processed foods have a lower GI. For example, whole fruits have lower GI compared to fruit juice as the skin and pulp have not been removed. Food that is less broken down by cooking has a lower GI. For example, for the same amount of grain, boiled rice has a lower GI compared to porridge which takes longer to cook. In a meal where carbohydrates are mixed with protein and other food types, the GI will be lower. For example, the same amount of rice eaten with meat and vegetable side dishes will have a lower GI than if it were eaten on its own. Many factors can affect the GI of food including: [Missing content]",11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf,17
"A high fat content in a meal can lower the glycemic index (GI). Meal 2 may have a lower GI due to its high fat content, but it is a high-calorie dish that can lead to weight gain in the long run.

Check the menu before arriving to plan your meal better.

- Read the menu carefully to see how the food is prepared. Choose foods that are described as 'steamed', 'boiled', 'baked', or 'poached' as they are healthier than foods fried in oil. Avoid dishes that are 'rich' and 'creamy' as they tend to be high in fat.

- Eat until you are 80% full and don't feel pressured to finish everything on your plate. To avoid food wastage, ask to take away any remaining food for later consumption. Remember not to leave cooked food at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Reheat stored cooked food at temperatures above 75°C before consuming.
