title: Diabetic Foot Ulcer: Symptoms and Treatment

Diabetic foot ulcers are open sores or wounds that develop due to poor circulation or lack of sensation caused by nerve damage from elevated blood glucose levels. These ulcers commonly occur on the legs and feet, posing a higher risk for individuals with diabetes. The condition makes it difficult for the body to heal, leading to chronic wounds and an increased risk of infection. It is essential to understand the causes of diabetic ulcers and prioritize self-care, prevention, and appropriate treatment to manage this condition effectively. Significantly, nonhealing diabetic ulcers in Singapore result in a large number of amputations, with about two major limb amputations being carried out daily to remove lower limbs affected by diabetes-related ulcers or gangrene. This highlights the serious impact of these ulcers on individuals and the healthcare system, emphasizing the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to address this issue.

Diabetic Ulcer Prevention. To reduce the risk of wounds, regular foot care is important for those with diabetes. Take these steps to reduce foot injuries and wounds: Check your feet every day for red spots, cuts, swelling, or blisters. Use a mirror or get help to inspect the bottom of your feet. Wash your feet every day and dry them carefully, especially between the toes. Moisturize your feet daily, ideally after washing, to keep the skin soft and smooth. Massage a thin coat of lotion over the top and bottom of your feet, but not between the toes as the skin is thinner and more prone to splitting. File away hard skin patches on the sole of the feet or toes at least once a week to prevent foot ulcers from forming underneath. Keep toenails trimmed to prevent them from cutting into your toes. Cut toenails straight across and file the edges, never into the sides as this causes ingrown nails. Always wear shoes and socks, and never walk barefoot to prevent injuries.To maintain healthy feet, it is important to take preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot to prevent injuries. Ensuring that your shoes are comfortable and fit well is also crucial for foot health. Additionally, maintaining good blood circulation to the feet is essential. This can be achieved by putting your feet up when sitting, wiggling your toes, and moving your ankles for at least five minutes, two to three times a day. It is also advised not to cross your legs for long periods of time and to avoid smoking, as smoking can harm blood circulation and increase the risk of various diseases. Regular foot examinations are crucial for individuals with diabetes to prevent foot and leg ulcers and maintain good foot health. During these examinations, a podiatrist will assess for any loss of sensation, the level of blood flow to the feet, and changes in the foot's shape to identify potential pressure points. These evaluations aid in detecting early signs of foot conditions and allow for prompt preventive treatment or management to prevent the development or worsening of wounds.
