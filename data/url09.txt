title: Diabetes: Recommended Vaccinations for Children and Adults - HealthXchange

Diabetes, a condition requiring careful and consistent management, necessitates specific attention to vaccinations for both children and adults. Dr. Bee Yong Mong, a leading figure at the SingHealth Duke-NUS Diabetes Centre and a Senior Consultant in the Department of Endocrinology at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), underscores the importance of routine vaccinations for individuals with diabetes. Highlighted below are the key vaccinations recommended and essential considerations surrounding them.

Essential Vaccinations for Diabetes Patients: Influenza Vaccination: An annual necessity for individuals with diabetes over the age of 6 months, this vaccination combats the decline in immunity observed one year post-vaccination. Administered via a single intramuscular injection, it targets the three primary influenza strains prevalent during the flu season.

Pneumococcal Vaccination: This critical vaccination, delivered as a single intramuscular injection, is available in two forms: Pneumovax 23 (PPV23) and Prevenar 13 (PCV13). It provides broad protection against numerous strains of pneumococcus responsible for various diseases. Dr. Bee Yong Mong advises that when both vaccines are necessary, PCV13 should precede PPV23, administered at least one year apart, to maximize immunity.

For children, PCV13 is recommended for infants under 2 years as a series of four doses starting at 2 months. PPV23 is advised for children aged 2 to 5 years who haven't received PCV13 and for all children over 2 years of age.

Adults under 65 with diabetes are recommended to receive PPV23, while those 65 and older should receive both PCV13 and PPV23. Even those vaccinated against pneumococcus before 65 should receive PCV13 and a PPV23 booster after turning 65.

Hepatitis B Vaccination: Administered over three injections within six months, this vaccine is recommended for all children and adolescents with diabetes. Adults under 60 with diabetes should also receive it, and those over 60 can consider it after consulting with their healthcare provider.

Pre-Vaccination Considerations. Before receiving any vaccination, it's crucial to discuss any potential concerns with your healthcare provider, including: Previous serious reactions to vaccines or specific antibiotics, Allergies to eggs or yeast, Conditions leading to bleeding risks, Current illnesses that might necessitate postponing vaccination. These vaccination guidelines are in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the American Diabetes Association. Following these recommendations not only protects individuals with diabetes from serious illnesses but also contributes to their overall health management strategy.
