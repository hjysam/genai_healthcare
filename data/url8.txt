title: Diabetes Treatment: Insulin

When you have diabetes, you may need to learn how to inject yourself with insulin. Insulin is a crucial component of diabetes treatment, and understanding how to administer it properly is essential for managing the condition effectively. Proper injection technique and dosage are key factors in ensuring that insulin therapy is successful in controlling blood sugar levels. It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized insulin treatment plan that meets your specific needs and lifestyle. By following the guidance of your healthcare team and staying informed about diabetes management, you can take control of your health and well-being. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and released into our body cells to allow them to convert blood glucose (sugar) for energy. Food is converted into glucose before it is absorbed into our bloodstream. The function of insulin is to move the glucose from the bloodstream into the body cells for use or storage. People with diabetes are unable to fully use the glucose in their bloodstream either because they lack insulin in the body or insulin is ineffective for them. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves dietary control and insulin injections. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may also require insulin injections. Insulin is not effective if taken by mouth, and has to be injected. To manage insulin therapy effectively, it is important to know how to measure your insulin dose, inject yourself (and not rely on others), and adapt your diet and activity to your insulin injections. There are several types of insulin that vary in their onset of action, peak activity, and duration of effectiveness. These differences determine how quickly they can lower blood glucose levels and how long their effects last. It is important to understand the characteristics of each type of insulin to effectively manage blood sugar levels. The type of action refers to the specific category or classification of the drug's effects. This could include categories such as analgesic, sedative, stimulant, or antihistamine. The time of start of action indicates how long it takes for the drug to begin producing noticeable effects after it has been administered. This can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration and the individual's metabolism. The time of maximum action refers to the point at which the drug's effects are at their peak intensity, providing the most significant therapeutic benefit or side effects. Understanding these parameters can help healthcare providers optimize treatment regimens and manage potential adverse reactions effectively. The duration of action of different types of insulin varies. Rapid-acting insulins like Lispro typically start working within 5 minutes and last for 2-4 hours. Short-acting insulins such as Humulin® R and Actrapid® HM have a half-hour onset and last for 6-8 hours. Intermediate-acting insulins like Humulin® N/NPH and Humulin® L/lente have a longer duration, lasting up to 24 hours. Long-acting insulins like Humulin® U have a duration of up to 24 hours.

It is important to note that low blood sugar reactions are more likely to occur around the time of maximum insulin action, while high blood sugar reactions are more likely before the insulin starts acting or when its action is ending. Combination insulins, such as Humulin® 30/70 and Mixtard®, are mixtures of short and intermediate-acting insulins that are administered twice a day. This combination helps avoid the need for patients to manually mix their insulins and provides a more convenient dosing schedule for patients. The daily requirement is typically divided into two parts, with a portion given in the morning and the remainder in the evening. This division helps ensure that the necessary nutrients and energy are spread out throughout the day, providing a steady source of fuel for the body. By following this schedule, individuals can maintain a balanced and consistent intake of essential nutrients to support their overall health and well-being. Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer, and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty area under the skin, where it moves into the blood and is used by your body. There are three main areas of injection: the abdomen, where insulin moves fastest into the blood; the arm; and the thigh and buttocks, where insulin moves slowest into the blood. The injection area is chosen based on the speed of insulin absorption required and your convenience. Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject, as changing injection areas frequently can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels due to insulin moving into the blood at different speeds from different areas. It is important to rotate your insulin injection spot each time to prevent the formation of thick areas under the skin, which can hinder proper absorption of the insulin. By using a different spot each time and only using each spot once a month, you can avoid these issues. Regularly checking your injection areas for any lumps, painful spots, or changes in color is also recommended, and any issues should be reported to your diabetes care team to address them promptly. Timing your insulin injections is crucial for optimal effectiveness. Injecting insulin 30 minutes before meals allows it to match the rise in blood sugar levels that occur after eating. It is important to eat regularly throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar levels caused by the injected insulin. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your insulin therapy is effective and properly managed. If you are using a new insulin called Lispro Insulin (Humalog®), you do not have to wait 30 minutes before eating your meal as it is absorbed and goes to work almost immediately after injection. Insulin should be stored in the lower part of the fridge, away from the freezer, and it is important to keep at least one extra bottle of each type of insulin on hand. When travelling, it is recommended to carry your insulin and syringes with you and avoid putting the insulin in your check-in luggage or car boot.

When it comes to insulin usage, it is crucial to discard the insulin if it has expired, if there is any contamination of clear (short-acting) insulin, or if there are any lumps in cloudy (intermediate-acting) insulin that will not dissolve when the bottle is rotated. Syringes are used to measure the amount of insulin to be injected, so it is important to choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required. When administering insulin, it is important to use the correct syringe size based on the prescribed dose. A 0.3ml syringe is suitable for doses up to 30 units, while a 0.5ml syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. For doses up to 100 units, a 1ml syringe is recommended. Disposable syringes can be reused for the same person up to about two to four times, with the syringe being stored in the fridge between uses and the cap replaced. Insulin pens offer a convenient alternative to traditional syringes and insulin bottles, as they combine the needle and insulin cartridge into one device. This makes insulin injections easier to administer and eliminates the need to carry multiple items when on the go. On the other hand, insulin pumps are small computerized devices that deliver insulin continuously through a tube inserted under the skin. While providing better control and meal flexibility, insulin pump users must monitor their blood sugar levels frequently to adjust the insulin delivery accordingly. However, insulin pumps are more expensive and require more frequent blood sugar monitoring compared to traditional injection methods. Switching to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets can be a cause for concern for some patients, as they may fear that their condition is worsening. However, this transition is often necessary when the diabetes is no longer effectively controlled by oral medications. The switch to insulin is made to better manage the patient's blood sugar levels and prevent further complications.It is important to be aware of potential side effects that may arise from taking insulin. These can include experiencing low blood sugar, initial weight gain, and the development of lumpy or scarred tissue from repeated injections in the same area. Additionally, some individuals may experience rashes at the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body. Being informed about these possible side effects can help patients better manage their insulin therapy and address any concerns they may have.
