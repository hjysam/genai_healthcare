The process begins with the diagnosis of pre-diabetes, which can be determined by one of two criteria. Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) is characterized by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L and a 2-hour post-load glucose (2-h PG) level of less than 7.8 mmol/L. Alternatively, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is defined by an FPG level of less than 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-h PG level between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L. For all persons with pre-diabetes, a lifestyle intervention is recommended. This includes education on a healthy diet and increased physical activity. For those who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a body mass index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or to realize a 5-10% body weight loss. Regular follow-up is crucial and should include monitoring at least every six months with BMI and FPG, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or HbA1c assessments as appropriate. Additionally, yearly screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is advised. Reinforcement of behavioral changes is also a key component of regular follow-up. In cases where an individual’s glycemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention, adding metformin is advised. Before beginning metformin, measure HbA1c and renal function. The starting dose for metformin is 250 mg twice daily, which may be gradually increased as tolerated based on glycemic status, up to 850 mg twice daily. Even with the introduction of metformin, continuing lifestyle intervention is recommended unless it is unfeasible for the individual to do so. For those unable to adopt a lifestyle intervention, the approach to metformin administration remains the same. Finally, regular follow-up should be continued with monitoring every six months with BMI and HbA1c reviews. Renal function should be assessed at least yearly. Yearly screenings for CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia should continue. There is also a suggestion to consider monitoring vitamin B12 levels, especially for those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy. The pathway for management also indicates that if the HbA1c level is 7.0% or higher, management should proceed as it would for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). If after metformin intervention the fasting plasma glucose or OGTT are not reflective of T2DM, a metformin washout period of 1-2 weeks is recommended for further testing.' metadata={'page': 4, 'source': 'https://www.ace-hta.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-library/managing-pre-diabetes-(updated-on-27-jul-2021)c2bfc77474154c2abf623156a4b93002.pdf'}"", 'page_content=\'First trimester: Who to screen: Women at increased risk of diabetes, Screening tests: FPG/2-point OGTT, Glucose thresholds: Pre-existing diabetes: FPG ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-hour post-OGTT ≥11.1 mmol/L.

The image also includes icons suggesting that lifestyle interventions may include activities such as healthy eating, cycling, and other forms of physical exercise. Implementing lifestyle intervention through diet is crucial for managing pre-diabetes. This approach emphasizes portion control and the avoidance of certain types of food and beverages. For a healthy diet, it is suggested to portion your plate in the following way: 25% should consist of lean meat, low-fat dairy, or soy products; another 25% should be whole grains, such as brown rice; and the remaining 50% of the plate should be filled with vegetables and a small portion of fruits. In terms of beverages and food, it is recommended to avoid sugar-sweetened items, as indicated by a Say No message over a glass of fruit juice. Alcohol consumption should also be limited. For females, the intake should be restricted to one standard drink per day, which is equivalent to approximately 100ml of wine, 285ml of beer, or 30ml of spirits. For males, the intake should be limited to two standard drinks per day. By following these guidelines, one can effectively manage pre-diabetes through dietary intervention. The recommendations for lifestyle modifications focus on physical activity and other health-related changes. For physical activity, there are two options: engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or leisure cycling, or alternatively, pursue at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity exercise, such as jogging or fast-paced cycling. The importance of regularity in exercise is also noted, suggesting that one should not have more than two consecutive days without exercise to maintain effectiveness. In addition to these, other modifications include smoking cessation. This is indicated by an icon of a person with a cancelled cigarette symbol, emphasizing the importance of stopping smoking as part of a healthy lifestyle change. By following these recommendations, one can make significant strides towards a healthier lifestyle. The two-part strategy on how to sustain lifestyle changes involves tailoring lifestyle intervention to individual needs and reinforcing behavioral changes. The first part of the strategy emphasizes the importance of personalizing the intervention. This involves taking into account personal preferences, considering the individual’s budget, adapting to the physical condition of the person, and factoring in the nature of the individual\'s work. The second part of the strategy focuses on reinforcing behavioral changes by encouraging a regular log of diet, exercise, and weight. Keeping a diet log helps monitor eating habits and nutritional intake. An exercise log keeps track of physical activity, and a weight log helps observe changes and progress over time.

The process begins with the diagnosis of pre-diabetes, which can be determined by one of two criteria. Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) is characterized by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L and a 2-hour post-load glucose (2-h PG) level of less than 7.8 mmol/L. Alternatively, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is defined by an FPG level of less than 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-h PG level between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L. For all persons with pre-diabetes, a lifestyle intervention is recommended. This includes education on a healthy diet and increased physical activity. For those who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a body mass index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or to realize a 5-10% body weight loss. Regular follow-up is crucial and should include monitoring at least every six months with BMI and FPG, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or HbA1c assessments as appropriate. Additionally, yearly screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is advised. Reinforcement of behavioral changes is also a key component of regular follow-up. In cases where an individual’s glycemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention, adding metformin is advised. Before beginning metformin, measure HbA1c and renal function. The starting dose for metformin is 250 mg twice daily, which may be gradually increased as tolerated based on glycemic status, up to 850 mg twice daily. Even with the introduction of metformin, continuing lifestyle intervention is recommended unless it is unfeasible for the individual to do so. For those unable to adopt a lifestyle intervention, the approach to metformin administration remains the same. Finally, regular follow-up should be continued with monitoring every six months with BMI and HbA1c reviews. Renal function should be assessed at least yearly. Yearly screenings for CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia should continue. There is also a suggestion to consider monitoring vitamin B12 levels, especially for those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy. The pathway for management also indicates that if the HbA1c level is 7.0% or higher, management should proceed as it would for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). If after metformin intervention the fasting plasma glucose or OGTT are not reflective of T2DM, a metformin washout period of 1-2 weeks is recommended for further testing.' metadata={'page': 4, 'source': 'https://www.ace-hta.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-library/managing-pre-diabetes-(updated-on-27-jul-2021)c2bfc77474154c2abf623156a4b93002.pdf'}"", ""page_content='Lifestyle intervention Lifestyle intervention is recommended for all persons with pre-diabetes, as adopting healthy diet and increased physical activity reduces the risk of them developing T2DM by 31 to 37% over 2 to 6 years, and is cost-effective.3-5 For those who are overweight or obese, aim to gradually achieve and maintain a BMI of < 23 kg/m2 or a 5 to 10% body weight loss.

What will be the impact of poor medication adherence,"['page_content=""It is crucial to understand that consistency in taking your diabetes medication is key to managing your condition effectively. Skipping doses or not following the prescribed regimen can lead to fluctuations in blood sugar levels and potentially compromise your health. By adhering to your medication schedule as directed by your healthcare provider, you can better control your diabetes and reduce the risk of complications. Remember, these tablets are designed to support your well-being, but their effectiveness relies on your commitment to taking them regularly. Medications are an important aspect of healthcare, and finding the right ones can greatly improve a person\'s quality of life. Support groups can also play a crucial role in providing emotional and practical assistance to individuals dealing with various health conditions.

The patient\\\'s overall health status includes age or frailty, life expectancy and quality of life, and comorbidities. Concurrent treatment factors include the current treatment, risk factors that may reduce treatment adherence, and recent changes to health or life circumstances. Wellbeing and social support factors consider the patient\\\'s wellbeing and social support, and cognitive ability. Medication-related factors include patient adherence, safety considerations such as the risk of hypoglycaemia, implications on weight, cost and affordability, route of administration, dosing frequency, and patient preferences, needs, and values. The chart outlines three primary steps: A: Assess Clinical Needs: This involves assessing the patient\\\'s current HbA1c relative to target HbA1c, the presence of risk of hypoglycaemia, and the presence of microvascular complications. It also considers the risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes, history of CVD or CKD, presence of macrovascular complications, risk of CVD based on risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature coronary disease, CKD, or presence of albuminuria, and risk of CKD based on risk factors such as CVD, hypertension, obesity, family history of CKD or ESKD, history of AKI, age (especially ≥ 65 years), or smoking. B: Select & Adjust T2DM Medications Based on Clinical Needs: This involves selecting medication(s) proven to reduce HbA1c, reduce cardiorenal risk (beyond glycaemic control), and reduce both HbA1c and cardiorenal risk. C: Review Response to T2DM Treatment and Progress Against Goals: This involves reviewing the patient\\\'s response to the T2DM treatment and their progress against the set goals.

Why does a diabetic patient need to learn how to inject insulin,"[""page_content='For individuals with diabetes.' metadata={'page': 45, 'source': '11.DiabetesHub-NDRM2023-En-02-BeHealthy.pdf'}"", 'page_content=""When you have diabetes, you may need to learn how to inject yourself with insulin. Insulin is a crucial component of diabetes treatment, and understanding how to administer it properly is essential for managing the condition effectively. Proper injection technique and dosage are key factors in ensuring that insulin therapy is successful in controlling blood sugar levels. It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized insulin treatment plan that meets your specific needs and lifestyle. By following the guidance of your healthcare team and staying informed about diabetes management, you can take control of your health and well-being. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and released into our body cells to allow them to convert blood glucose (sugar) for energy. Food is converted into glucose before it is absorbed into our bloodstream. The function of insulin is to move the glucose from the bloodstream into the body cells for use or storage. People with diabetes are unable to fully use the glucose in their bloodstream either because they lack insulin in the body or insulin is ineffective for them. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves dietary control and insulin injections. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may also require insulin injections. Insulin is not effective if taken by mouth, and has to be injected. To manage insulin therapy effectively, it is important to know how to measure your insulin dose, inject yourself (and not rely on others), and adapt your diet and activity to your insulin injections. There are several types of insulin that vary in their onset of action, peak activity, and duration of effectiveness. These differences determine how quickly they can lower blood glucose levels and how long their effects last. It is important to understand the characteristics of each type of insulin to effectively manage blood sugar levels. The type of action refers to the specific category or classification of the drug\'s effects. This could include categories such as analgesic, sedative, stimulant, or antihistamine. The time of start of action indicates how long it takes for the drug to begin producing noticeable effects after it has been administered. This can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration and the individual\'s metabolism. The time of maximum action refers to the point at which the drug\'s effects are at their peak intensity, providing the most significant therapeutic benefit or side effects. Understanding these parameters can help healthcare providers optimize treatment regimens and manage potential adverse reactions effectively. The duration of action of different types of insulin varies. Rapid-acting insulins like Lispro typically start working within 5 minutes and last for 2-4 hours.

Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer, and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty area under the skin, where it moves into the blood and is used by your body. There are three main areas of injection: the abdomen, where insulin moves fastest into the blood; the arm; and the thigh and buttocks, where insulin moves slowest into the blood. The injection area is chosen based on the speed of insulin absorption required and your convenience. Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject, as changing injection areas frequently can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels due to insulin moving into the blood at different speeds from different areas. It is important to rotate your insulin injection spot each time to prevent the formation of thick areas under the skin, which can hinder proper absorption of the insulin. By using a different spot each time and only using each spot once a month, you can avoid these issues. Regularly checking your injection areas for any lumps, painful spots, or changes in color is also recommended, and any issues should be reported to your diabetes care team to address them promptly. Timing your insulin injections is crucial for optimal effectiveness. Injecting insulin 30 minutes before meals allows it to match the rise in blood sugar levels that occur after eating. It is important to eat regularly throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar levels caused by the injected insulin. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your insulin therapy is effective and properly managed.

Syringes are used to measure the amount of insulin to be injected, so it is important to choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required. When administering insulin, it is important to use the correct syringe size based on the prescribed dose. A 0.3ml syringe is suitable for doses up to 30 units, while a 0.5ml syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. For doses up to 100 units, a 1ml syringe is recommended. Disposable syringes can be reused for the same person up to about two to four times, with the syringe being stored in the fridge between uses and the cap replaced. Insulin pens offer a convenient alternative to traditional syringes and insulin bottles, as they combine the needle and insulin cartridge into one device. This makes insulin injections easier to administer and eliminates the need to carry multiple items when on the go. On the other hand, insulin pumps are small computerized devices that deliver insulin continuously through a tube inserted under the skin. While providing better control and meal flexibility, insulin pump users must monitor their blood sugar levels frequently to adjust the insulin delivery accordingly. However, insulin pumps are more expensive and require more frequent blood sugar monitoring compared to traditional injection methods. Switching to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets can be a cause for concern for some patients, as they may fear that their condition is worsening. However, this transition is often necessary when the diabetes is no longer effectively controlled by oral medications. The switch to insulin is made to better manage the patient\'s blood sugar levels and prevent further complications.It is important to be aware of potential side effects that may arise from taking insulin. These can include experiencing low blood sugar, initial weight gain, and the development of lumpy or scarred tissue from repeated injections in the same area.

It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized insulin treatment plan that meets your specific needs and lifestyle. By following the guidance of your healthcare team and staying informed about diabetes management, you can take control of your health and well-being. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and released into our body cells to allow them to convert blood glucose (sugar) for energy. Food is converted into glucose before it is absorbed into our bloodstream. The function of insulin is to move the glucose from the bloodstream into the body cells for use or storage. People with diabetes are unable to fully use the glucose in their bloodstream either because they lack insulin in the body or insulin is ineffective for them. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves dietary control and insulin injections. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may also require insulin injections. Insulin is not effective if taken by mouth, and has to be injected. To manage insulin therapy effectively, it is important to know how to measure your insulin dose, inject yourself (and not rely on others), and adapt your diet and activity to your insulin injections. There are several types of insulin that vary in their onset of action, peak activity, and duration of effectiveness. These differences determine how quickly they can lower blood glucose levels and how long their effects last. It is important to understand the characteristics of each type of insulin to effectively manage blood sugar levels. The type of action refers to the specific category or classification of the drug\'s effects. This could include categories such as analgesic, sedative, stimulant, or antihistamine. The time of start of action indicates how long it takes for the drug to begin producing noticeable effects after it has been administered. This can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration and the individual\'s metabolism. The time of maximum action refers to the point at which the drug\'s effects are at their peak intensity, providing the most significant therapeutic benefit or side effects. Understanding these parameters can help healthcare providers optimize treatment regimens and manage potential adverse reactions effectively. The duration of action of different types of insulin varies. Rapid-acting insulins like Lispro typically start working within 5 minutes and last for 2-4 hours.
