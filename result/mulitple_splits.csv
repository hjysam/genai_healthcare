"('page_content', 'Pathway for managing pre-diabetes. The process begins with the diagnosis of pre-diabetes, which can be determined by one of two criteria. Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG) is characterized by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels between 6.1 and 6.9 mmol/L and a 2-hour post-load glucose (2-h PG) level of less than 7.8 mmol/L. Alternatively, Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) is defined by an FPG level of less than 7.0 mmol/L and a 2-h PG level between 7.8 and 11.0 mmol/L. For all persons with pre-diabetes, a lifestyle intervention is recommended. This includes education on a healthy diet and increased physical activity. For those who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a body mass index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or to realize a 5-10% body weight loss. Regular follow-up is crucial and should include monitoring at least every six months with BMI and FPG, Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), or HbA1c assessments as appropriate. Additionally, yearly screening for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, is advised. Reinforcement of behavioral changes is also a key component of regular follow-up. In cases where an individual’s glycemic status does not improve despite lifestyle intervention, adding metformin is advised. Before beginning metformin, measure HbA1c and renal function. The starting dose for metformin is 250 mg twice daily, which may be gradually increased as tolerated based on glycemic status, up to 850 mg twice daily. Even with the introduction of metformin, continuing lifestyle intervention is recommended unless it is unfeasible for the individual to do so. For those unable to adopt a lifestyle intervention, the approach to metformin administration remains the same. Finally, regular follow-up should be continued with monitoring every six months with BMI and HbA1c reviews. Renal function should be assessed at least yearly. Yearly screenings for CVD risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia should continue. There is also a suggestion to consider monitoring vitamin B12 levels, especially for those with anemia or peripheral neuropathy. The pathway for management also indicates that if the HbA1c level is 7.0% or higher, management should proceed as it would for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). If after metformin intervention the fasting plasma glucose or OGTT are not reflective of T2DM, a metformin washout period of 1-2 weeks is recommended for further testing.')","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.ace-hta.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-library/managing-pre-diabetes-(updated-on-27-jul-2021)c2bfc77474154c2abf623156a4b93002.pdf', 'page': 4})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', ""Overview of lifestyle intervention in pre-diabetes. Role of lifestyle intervention in pre-diabetes management. It highlights that lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) by 31% to 37% over a period of 2 to 6 years. For individuals who are overweight or obese, the goal is to gradually achieve and maintain a Body Mass Index (BMI) of less than 23 kg/m² or accomplish a 5 to 10% reduction in body weight. The image also includes icons suggesting that lifestyle interventions may include activities such as healthy eating, cycling, and other forms of physical exercise. Implementing lifestyle intervention through diet is crucial for managing pre-diabetes. This approach emphasizes portion control and the avoidance of certain types of food and beverages. For a healthy diet, it is suggested to portion your plate in the following way: 25% should consist of lean meat, low-fat dairy, or soy products; another 25% should be whole grains, such as brown rice; and the remaining 50% of the plate should be filled with vegetables and a small portion of fruits. In terms of beverages and food, it is recommended to avoid sugar-sweetened items, as indicated by a Say No message over a glass of fruit juice. Alcohol consumption should also be limited. For females, the intake should be restricted to one standard drink per day, which is equivalent to approximately 100ml of wine, 285ml of beer, or 30ml of spirits. For males, the intake should be limited to two standard drinks per day. By following these guidelines, one can effectively manage pre-diabetes through dietary intervention. The recommendations for lifestyle modifications focus on physical activity and other health-related changes. For physical activity, there are two options: engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking or leisure cycling, or alternatively, pursue at least 75 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity exercise, such as jogging or fast-paced cycling. The importance of regularity in exercise is also noted, suggesting that one should not have more than two consecutive days without exercise to maintain effectiveness. In addition to these, other modifications include smoking cessation. This is indicated by an icon of a person with a cancelled cigarette symbol, emphasizing the importance of stopping smoking as part of a healthy lifestyle change. By following these recommendations, one can make significant strides towards a healthier lifestyle. The two-part strategy on how to sustain lifestyle changes involves tailoring lifestyle intervention to individual needs and reinforcing behavioral changes. The first part of the strategy emphasizes the importance of personalizing the intervention. This involves taking into account personal preferences, considering the individual’s budget, adapting to the physical condition of the person, and factoring in the nature of the individual's work. The second part of the strategy focuses on reinforcing behavioral changes by encouraging a regular log of diet, exercise, and weight. Keeping a diet log helps monitor eating habits and nutritional intake. An exercise log keeps track of physical activity, and a weight log helps observe changes and progress over time. By implementing this two-part strategy, individuals can effectively sustain lifestyle changes and work towards their health goals."")","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.ace-hta.gov.sg/docs/default-source/default-library/managing-pre-diabetes-(updated-on-27-jul-2021)c2bfc77474154c2abf623156a4b93002.pdf', 'page': 5})","('type', 'Document')"

Assessment of a patient's glycaemic control and their risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes is critical to guide appropriate T2DM treatment, given their significant impact on diabetes morbidity and mortality. In this ACG, these two areas—glycaemic control, and risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes—are referred to as the patient's 'clinical needs'. For patients with newly diagnosed T2DM, assess their clinical needs before discussing and deciding about appropriate treatment. For ongoing patients, reassess the patient's clinical needs against their current management goals and response. In both cases, complement this assessment with an evaluation of the patient's overall health status (see Figure 1 Patient's overall health status on page 3). Glycaemic control. The goal of T2DM management is to prevent or delay diabetes-related complications while improving the quality of life of patients.^4 A core part of this has been, and still remains, maintaining good glycaemic control in order to reduce the risk of microvascular complications. The target for Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) should be individualised based on the patient's overall health status, in consultation with the patient. For most patients, a target HbA1c of ≤7.0% provides a reasonable balance between a reduction in risk of microvascular complications and risk of hypoglycaemia. There are certain situations where a more stringent HbA1c target (e.g., ≤6.5%) may be appropriate. These include younger patients, patients with a short duration of disease, patients with a long life expectancy, and patients with early-stage microvascular complications (particularly retinopathy and nephropathy). Conversely, there are also situations where a less stringent HbA1c target (e.g., ≤8.0%) may be appropriate.

It takes into account various factors such as the patient\'s overall health status, concurrent treatment factors, wellbeing and social support factors, and medication-related factors. The patient\'s overall health status includes age or frailty, life expectancy and quality of life, and comorbidities. Concurrent treatment factors include the current treatment, risk factors that may reduce treatment adherence, and recent changes to health or life circumstances. Wellbeing and social support factors consider the patient\'s wellbeing and social support, and cognitive ability. Medication-related factors include patient adherence, safety considerations such as the risk of hypoglycaemia, implications on weight, cost and affordability, route of administration, dosing frequency, and patient preferences, needs, and values. The chart outlines three primary steps: A: Assess Clinical Needs: This involves assessing the patient\'s current HbA1c relative to target HbA1c, the presence of risk of hypoglycaemia, and the presence of microvascular complications. It also considers the risk of adverse cardiorenal outcomes, history of CVD or CKD, presence of macrovascular complications, risk of CVD based on risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, family history of premature coronary disease, CKD, or presence of albuminuria, and risk of CKD based on risk factors such as CVD, hypertension, obesity, family history of CKD or ESKD, history of AKI, age (especially ≥ 65 years), or smoking.

Both medications effectively reduce HbA1c levels to a similar degree, but sulphonylureas are associated with greater weight gain and a higher risk of hypoglycemia. However, there is limited systematic data available for comparing metformin to newer T2DM medication classes, particularly as a first-line treatment. Most international guidelines recommend metformin as the first-line medication for T2DM. Nonetheless, some guidelines suggest that Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be suitable initial treatments, especially for patients with T2DM who are at high risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). This recommendation is based on increasing evidence supporting the cardiovascular and renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs, as well as limited post-hoc subgroup analyses suggesting that these benefits may exist independently of metformin use.

However, in certain situations, starting with dual therapy may be considered. For instance, dual therapy may be appropriate for patients for whom monotherapy alone is not expected to be sufficient, or when the initial HbA1c level is 1.5% or more above the target. Some international guidelines support this approach, recommending dual therapy, particularly for patients with higher initial HbA1c levels, to enhance the likelihood of achieving treatment goals and to expedite the attainment of glycemic targets. Additionally, dual therapy might be recommended due to the potential benefits offered by another medication independent of its effect on HbA1c.

SGLT2 inhibitors: Renal impairment: Dose adjustment(s) may be required, with eGFR cut-offs varying between medications and indications (e.g., using for glycaemic control vs other benefits such as reducing risk of ESKD or reducing the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure). Hepatic impairment: Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment: Precautions: Reports of (euglycaemic) diabetic ketoacidosis, necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene), symptomatic hypotension (especially in elderly and those on diuretics). Monitoring: patients with a higher risk for amputation events (canagliflozin). GLP-1 RAs: Renal impairment: Dose adjustment not required; use not recommended in ESKD (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m²). Hepatic impairment: Use not recommended in severe hepatic impairment. Precautions: Possible risk of acute pancreatitis and dehydration (may lead to acute renal failure or worsening renal impairment). Semaglutide (subcutaneous): Exercise caution in patients with history of diabetic retinopathy or treated with insulin. Impact on weight: Both classes are associated with weight loss (e.g., 2-3 kg with SGLT2 inhibitors, 1.1-4.4 kg with GLP-1 RAs*).Cost and affordability: Both classes relatively new, hence considerably more expensive than more established T2DM medication classes.

Women are considered to be at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes if any risk factor is present, such as: Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) ≥ 23 kg/m², History of GDM (or delivered a baby ≥ 4 kg), History of polycystic ovary syndrome, History of pre-diabetes, Age ≥ 40 years, Family history of diabetes (first degree relative) and Hypertension. Individual patient circumstances should also be taken into consideration when evaluating the need to test with fasting plasma glucose (FPG)/2-point 75 g OGTT. If results are normal, re-evaluate women for GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. While all women with diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy (including GDM) require timely management (including lifestyle intervention), those with pre-existing diabetes are at higher risk of poor diabetes outcomes than those with GDM. Hence, women with pre-existing diabetes require more stringent measures to reduce their risk of diabetes complications, including tighter glycaemic control and screening for complications (such as eye checks).')","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.ace-hta.gov.sg/docs/default-source/acgs/gdm---an-update-on-screening-diagnosis-and-follow-up-(may-2018).pdf', 'page': 2})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', ""24–28 weeks Screen for GDM in all women without diabetes or pre-diabetes: Screening for GDM is recommended at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation because this phase coincides with an increase in gestational insulin resistance. With the higher prevalence of GDM in Asian populations, universal screening is favoured over risk-based screening for GDM. Apart from detecting more women with GDM, universal screening is associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes compared to risk-based screening. At 24 to 28 weeks of gestation, use 3-point 75 g OGTT to screen all women for GDM—unless they have already been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. This includes re-evaluating women at increased risk of pre-existing diabetes who had normal test results in their first trimester. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) 3-point diagnostic criteria for GDM using 75 g OGTT have been adopted by many organizations, including the World Health Organization and Singapore's College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.5,16 These criteria are based on findings from the Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes study, a large observational study which included patients from Singapore. GDM is diagnosed if any of the IADPSG 3-point diagnostic criteria is met (Table 1). Compared to the previously used 2-point criteria the IADPSG 3-point criteria identify a higher proportion of women at risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, so more women and their babies can benefit from appropriate GDM management.

Women with a history of GDM are about 10 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than women who had a normoglycaemic pregnancy. In Singapore, it is estimated that 4 in 10 women with a history of GDM develop T2DM or pre-diabetes within 4 to 6 years from delivery. Among women with a history of GDM, more frequent follow-up may be required for those who received insulin during pregnancy or those with other risk factors for developing diabetes such as non-pregnancy BMI <23 kg/m² or a family history of diabetes.

Significantly, nonhealing diabetic ulcers in Singapore result in a large number of amputations, with about two major limb amputations being carried out daily to remove lower limbs affected by diabetes-related ulcers or gangrene. This highlights the serious impact of these ulcers on individuals and the healthcare system, emphasizing the urgent need for effective prevention and treatment strategies to address this issue.')","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetic-ulcer', 'title': 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer: Symptoms and Treatment'})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', ""Diabetic Ulcer Prevention. To reduce the risk of wounds, regular foot care is important for those with diabetes. Take these steps to reduce foot injuries and wounds: Check your feet every day for red spots, cuts, swelling, or blisters. Use a mirror or get help to inspect the bottom of your feet. Wash your feet every day and dry them carefully, especially between the toes. Moisturize your feet daily, ideally after washing, to keep the skin soft and smooth. Massage a thin coat of lotion over the top and bottom of your feet, but not between the toes as the skin is thinner and more prone to splitting. File away hard skin patches on the sole of the feet or toes at least once a week to prevent foot ulcers from forming underneath. Keep toenails trimmed to prevent them from cutting into your toes. Cut toenails straight across and file the edges, never into the sides as this causes ingrown nails. Always wear shoes and socks, and never walk barefoot to prevent injuries.To maintain healthy feet, it is important to take preventive measures such as avoiding walking barefoot to prevent injuries. Ensuring that your shoes are comfortable and fit well is also crucial for foot health. Additionally, maintaining good blood circulation to the feet is essential. This can be achieved by putting your feet up when sitting, wiggling your toes, and moving your ankles for at least five minutes, two to three times a day. It is also advised not to cross your legs for long periods of time and to avoid smoking, as smoking can harm blood circulation and increase the risk of various diseases. Regular foot examinations are crucial for individuals with diabetes to prevent foot and leg ulcers and maintain good foot health. During these examinations, a podiatrist will assess for any loss of sensation, the level of blood flow to the feet, and changes in the foot's shape to identify potential pressure points. These evaluations aid in detecting early signs of foot conditions and allow for prompt preventive treatment or management to prevent the development or worsening of wounds."")","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetic-ulcer', 'title': 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer: Symptoms and Treatment'})","('type', 'Document')"

"('page_content', ""When you have diabetes, you may need to learn how to inject yourself with insulin. Insulin is a crucial component of diabetes treatment, and understanding how to administer it properly is essential for managing the condition effectively. Proper injection technique and dosage are key factors in ensuring that insulin therapy is successful in controlling blood sugar levels. It is important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop a personalized insulin treatment plan that meets your specific needs and lifestyle. By following the guidance of your healthcare team and staying informed about diabetes management, you can take control of your health and well-being. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and released into our body cells to allow them to convert blood glucose (sugar) for energy. Food is converted into glucose before it is absorbed into our bloodstream. The function of insulin is to move the glucose from the bloodstream into the body cells for use or storage. People with diabetes are unable to fully use the glucose in their bloodstream either because they lack insulin in the body or insulin is ineffective for them. Treatment for type 1 diabetes involves dietary control and insulin injections. Some patients with type 2 diabetes may also require insulin injections. Insulin is not effective if taken by mouth, and has to be injected. To manage insulin therapy effectively, it is important to know how to measure your insulin dose, inject yourself (and not rely on others), and adapt your diet and activity to your insulin injections. There are several types of insulin that vary in their onset of action, peak activity, and duration of effectiveness. These differences determine how quickly they can lower blood glucose levels and how long their effects last. It is important to understand the characteristics of each type of insulin to effectively manage blood sugar levels. The type of action refers to the specific category or classification of the drug's effects. This could include categories such as analgesic, sedative, stimulant, or antihistamine. The time of start of action indicates how long it takes for the drug to begin producing noticeable effects after it has been administered. This can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration and the individual's metabolism. The time of maximum action refers to the point at which the drug's effects are at their peak intensity, providing the most significant therapeutic benefit or side effects. Understanding these parameters can help healthcare providers optimize treatment regimens and manage potential adverse reactions effectively. The duration of action of different types of insulin varies. Rapid-acting insulins like Lispro typically start working within 5 minutes and last for 2-4 hours. Short-acting insulins such as Humulin® R and Actrapid® HM have a half-hour onset and last for 6-8 hours. Intermediate-acting insulins like Humulin® N/NPH and Humulin® L/lente have a longer duration, lasting up to 24 hours. Long-acting insulins like Humulin® U have a duration of up to 24 hours."")","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetes-treatment-insulin', 'title': 'Diabetes Treatment: Insulin'})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', 'It is important to note that low blood sugar reactions are more likely to occur around the time of maximum insulin action, while high blood sugar reactions are more likely before the insulin starts acting or when its action is ending. Combination insulins, such as Humulin® 30/70 and Mixtard®, are mixtures of short and intermediate-acting insulins that are administered twice a day. This combination helps avoid the need for patients to manually mix their insulins and provides a more convenient dosing schedule for patients. The daily requirement is typically divided into two parts, with a portion given in the morning and the remainder in the evening. This division helps ensure that the necessary nutrients and energy are spread out throughout the day, providing a steady source of fuel for the body. By following this schedule, individuals can maintain a balanced and consistent intake of essential nutrients to support their overall health and well-being. Knowing where to inject your insulin will make the injection easier, safer, and more comfortable. Insulin is injected into the fatty area under the skin, where it moves into the blood and is used by your body. There are three main areas of injection: the abdomen, where insulin moves fastest into the blood; the arm; and the thigh and buttocks, where insulin moves slowest into the blood. The injection area is chosen based on the speed of insulin absorption required and your convenience. Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the best area to inject, as changing injection areas frequently can cause fluctuations in blood sugar levels due to insulin moving into the blood at different speeds from different areas. It is important to rotate your insulin injection spot each time to prevent the formation of thick areas under the skin, which can hinder proper absorption of the insulin. By using a different spot each time and only using each spot once a month, you can avoid these issues. Regularly checking your injection areas for any lumps, painful spots, or changes in color is also recommended, and any issues should be reported to your diabetes care team to address them promptly. Timing your insulin injections is crucial for optimal effectiveness. Injecting insulin 30 minutes before meals allows it to match the rise in blood sugar levels that occur after eating. It is important to eat regularly throughout the day to prevent low blood sugar levels caused by the injected insulin. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your insulin therapy is effective and properly managed. If you are using a new insulin called Lispro Insulin (Humalog®), you do not have to wait 30 minutes before eating your meal as it is absorbed and goes to work almost immediately after injection. Insulin should be stored in the lower part of the fridge, away from the freezer, and it is important to keep at least one extra bottle of each type of insulin on hand. When travelling, it is recommended to carry your insulin and syringes with you and avoid putting the insulin in your check-in luggage or car boot.')","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetes-treatment-insulin', 'title': 'Diabetes Treatment: Insulin'})","('type', 'Document')"
"('page_content', ""When it comes to insulin usage, it is crucial to discard the insulin if it has expired, if there is any contamination of clear (short-acting) insulin, or if there are any lumps in cloudy (intermediate-acting) insulin that will not dissolve when the bottle is rotated. Syringes are used to measure the amount of insulin to be injected, so it is important to choose a suitable syringe that best matches the number of units required. When administering insulin, it is important to use the correct syringe size based on the prescribed dose. A 0.3ml syringe is suitable for doses up to 30 units, while a 0.5ml syringe should be used for doses up to 50 units. For doses up to 100 units, a 1ml syringe is recommended. Disposable syringes can be reused for the same person up to about two to four times, with the syringe being stored in the fridge between uses and the cap replaced. Insulin pens offer a convenient alternative to traditional syringes and insulin bottles, as they combine the needle and insulin cartridge into one device. This makes insulin injections easier to administer and eliminates the need to carry multiple items when on the go. On the other hand, insulin pumps are small computerized devices that deliver insulin continuously through a tube inserted under the skin. While providing better control and meal flexibility, insulin pump users must monitor their blood sugar levels frequently to adjust the insulin delivery accordingly. However, insulin pumps are more expensive and require more frequent blood sugar monitoring compared to traditional injection methods. Switching to insulin from anti-diabetes tablets can be a cause for concern for some patients, as they may fear that their condition is worsening. However, this transition is often necessary when the diabetes is no longer effectively controlled by oral medications. The switch to insulin is made to better manage the patient's blood sugar levels and prevent further complications.It is important to be aware of potential side effects that may arise from taking insulin. These can include experiencing low blood sugar, initial weight gain, and the development of lumpy or scarred tissue from repeated injections in the same area. Additionally, some individuals may experience rashes at the injection site or, in rare cases, all over the body. Being informed about these possible side effects can help patients better manage their insulin therapy and address any concerns they may have."")","('metadata', {'source': 'https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/diabetes-treatment-insulin', 'title': 'Diabetes Treatment: Insulin'})","('type', 'Document')"
